# DeepTweets
this is a classification model for tweets based on their theme (sports or politics);
there is a notebook for the code to create and train the model;
the datasets used for training and testing are labeled accordingly, there is also a submission sample that shows how the test results should be for evaluation of the prediction of the model later on;
You can also try to find a dataset of tweets resembling this one, and modify the code to take into consideration more labels than just sports and politics (binary);
also if you notice i used CNN for this model instead of a classic binary classification approach because oh well, why not go against the tide every once in a while and see if it can actually work, which it does (not brilliantly, but a 0.88 is still not bad);
